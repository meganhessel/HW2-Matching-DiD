### Introduction

In this assignment I will be doing political weather forecasting except the “storms” I care about are electoral swings that might follow local wind turbine development.

In Stokes (2015), the idea is that a policy with diffuse benefits (cleaner electricity) can create concentrated local costs (turbines nearby), and those local opponents may “send a signal” at the ballot box (i.e., NIMBYISM). Your job is to use two statistical tools:

-   Matching: Can we create a more apples-to-apples comparison between precincts that did vs. did not end up near turbine proposals?
-   Fixed effects + Difference-in-Differences: Can we use repeated elections to estimate how within-precinct changes in turbine exposure relate to changes in incumbent vote share?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### This repo is replicating the matching and fixed effects analyses from study:

### Part 1: Study Background

#### **1A.** Dive into the details of the study design and evaluation plan

> Goal: Get familiar with the study setting, environmental issue, and policy under evaluation.

::: callout
`NOTE:` Read over study to inform your response to the assignment questions. For this assignment we will skip-over sections that describe the *Instrumental Variables* identification strategy. We will cover instrumental variable designs weeks 6-7.
:::

**1A.Q1** Summarize the environmental policy issue, the outcome of interest, and the intervention being evaluated. Be sure to include a brief description of each of the following key elements of the study: unit of analysis, outcome, treatment, comparison group):

-   The centrist Liberal Party created a "feed-in tariff” (FIT) policy in the early 2000s to phase-out coal by subsidizing new, low-carbon technologies (ie wind). In 2009, a law passed that removed local veto power in renewable energy placement. The "not in my backyard" (NIMBY) thought process may have caused local voting to push the Liberal Party out of the government in the 2011 election. This, this study investigates if proximity to wind energy (intervention/treatment) impacted voting behaviors (outcome) with fixed effects estimators and instrumental variable estimators. To do this, Stokes studied the electoral precincts (average \~350 voters each) within the 26 districts.

    -   Treatment: precincts that had a proposed or operational wind turbine within its boundaries

    -   Control: precincts without wind turbines

    -   Outcome: Liberal Party vote in provincial elections (2003, 2007, 2011)

**1A.Q2** Why might turbine proposals be correlated with baseline political preferences or rural areas? Provide 2 plausible mechanisms, and explain why that creates confounding.

-   Wind turbines need open, unobstructive land to be effective. Therefore, wind turbine ideal placement is in rural areas. However, the baseline political preferences in rural communities tends to be more conservative, who would vote against the Liberal Party pre and post the FIT policy (the intervention). Studying the *change* in voting behavior in these communities is faulty and confounded since the people dealing with the treatment (wind turbines) have a continual pre-existing preferences against the treatment.

-   Before 2009 (when the law to remove local veto power), poorer communities most likely disproportional faced the burden of renewable energy construction. Wealthier, more urban communities have a greater ability to resist and/or block turbine proposals due to more money, power, time, and easier communication. Thus, wind turbine placement could be disproportionally placed in poorer communities which would already a pre-existing baseline political preferences.

-   These confounding variables impact the outcome, creating a fundamental problem in the study as treatment assignment is not randomized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **1B.** Break down the causal inference strategy and identify threats to identification:

**1B.Q1** What is the key identifying assumption for a fixed effects / Difference-in-Difference design? Explain how this assumption when satisfied provides evidence of causal effect:

-   Assumption: Parallel trends! Prior to the intervention, the treatment and control group must have similar trends in the voting behavior.

-   If the 2 groups are similar in there voting behaviors pre-intervention, it is save to assume the treatment group's counter factual would follow the control group trends. Parallel trends create a realistic counter factual we can use to understand intervention effects.

**1B.Q2** What is the reason for using a fixed effects approach from a causal inference perspective? Summarize within the context of study (in your own words).

-   From a causal inference perspective, fix effects remove omitted variable bias from time-invariant factors and remove between group variation. The fixed effect approach controls for any pre-exiting political or rural baseline beliefs, studing the change in voting shares within the precincts after intervention.

**1B.Q3** What part of the SUTVA assumption is most likely violated in the context of this study design (and why)?

-   SUTVA has 2 main assumptions: no interference and consistency. No interference means each treatment effect in one precincts would not effect the other. However, political voting behavior typically has active engagement within and between communities. Stokes discuss the protests and campaign events against the Liberal Party. Therefore, one community beliefs can easily effect and empower other precincts outcomes. SUTVA's consistency assumption means each treatment must be administered consistently to all treatment groups. Yet, treatment groups can have variable proposed or operational wind turbines due to differences in space. Hence, both SUTVA assumptions are violated.

**1B.Q4** Why does spillover matter when estimating an unbiased treatment effect?

-   In a perfect world, control and treatment groups would be un-affected by each other. However, this rarely is possible. Because of communication and interactions between communities, precincts actions can impact each other. This interaction and influence cause bias in treatment effect because it creates new confounding variables that effect outcomes in both groups.

**1B.Q5** How do the authors assess the risk of spillovers, and what analytic choice do they make to attempt to mitigate the risk that spillover biases the causal estimate?

-   In this study, spillover is due to the enormous wind turbines that can be seen in neighboring communities. To reduce the spillover treatment bias, Stoke studied voting behaviors in relation to distance from the turbines, creating 6km buffers that excludes these communities from the control group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Part 2: Matching

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will start by evaluating the 2007 survey (cross-sectional) data. Treatment is defined by whether a precinct is near a turbine proposal (within 3 km).

> Goal: Match precincts using pre-treatment covariates and then estimate the effect of proposed wind turbines on incumbent vote share.

#### **2A.** Load data for matching

1.  Read in data file `stokes15_survey2007.csv`
2.  Code `precinct_id` and `district_id` as factors
3.  Take a look at the data

```{r}
# Load in data 
match_data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "stokes15_survey2007.csv"))

# Change cols to factors 
match_data$precinct_id <- as.factor(match_data$precinct_id)
match_data$district_id <- as.factor(match_data$district_id)

# Look at the data 
head(match_data)
```

**2A.Q1** Intuition check: **Why match?** Explain rationale for using this method.

-   Due to confounding variables, there is pre-existing differences in the groups. Matching chooses communities that are similar, so treatment and control groups are homogeneous. This reduces the bias between the treatment and control groups.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **2B.** Check imbalance (before matching)

-   Create a covariate *balance table* comparing treated and control precincts
-   Treatment indicator: `proposed_turbine_3km`
-   Include pre-treatment covariates: `log_home_val_07`, `p_uni_degree`, `log_median_inc`, `log_pop_denc`
-   Use the `tbl_summary()` function from the `{gtsummary}` package.

```{r}

match_data %>% 
    select( # select column we want to compare 
        proposed_turbine_3km, change_liberal, log_wind_power, log_home_val_07, 
        p_
        
    ) %>% 
    tbl_summary (
        by = proposed_turbine_3km, 
        statistic = list(
            all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})",
            all_categorical() ~ "{n} ({p}%)"
    )
 
```

**2B.Q3** Intuition check: What type of data do you need to conduct a matching analysis?

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Conduct matching estimation using the {`MatchIt`} package:

📜 [Documentation - MatchIt](https://kosukeimai.github.io/MatchIt/)

Learning goals:

-   Approximate the Mahalanobis matching method used in Stokes (2015)
-   Implement another common matching approach called `propensity score matching`

::: callout
`NOTE`: In the replication code associated with Stokes (2015) the {`AER`} package is used for Mahalanobis matching. In this assignment we use the {`MatchIt`} package. The results are comparable but will not be exactly the same.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2C. Mahalanobis nearest-neighbor matching

-   Conduct Mahalanobis matching\
-   Use nearest-neighbor match without replacement using Mahalanobis distance
-   Use 1-to-1 matching (match one control unit to each treatment unit)
-   Extract the matched data using `match.data()`

```{r}
set.seed(2412026)

match_model <- matchit(
     # Treatment_indicator ~  Pre_treatment_covariates
  data = match_data, 
  method = "nearest",       # Nearest neighbor matching
  distance = "mahalanobis", # Mahalanobis distance
  ratio = 1,                # Match one control unit to one treatment unit (1:1 matching)
  replace = FALSE           # Control observations are not replaced
)

# Extract matched data
matched_data <- match.data(match_model)

```

```{r}
summary(match_model)
```

**2C.Q1** Using the `summary()` output: Which covariate had the largest and smallest `Std. Mean Diff.` before matching. Next, compare largest/smallest `Std. Mean Diff.` after matching.

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2D. Create a "love plot" using `love.plot()` ❤️

📜 [Documentation - cobalt](https://ngreifer.github.io/cobalt/)

-   Plot mean differences for data before & after matching across all pre-treatment covariates
-   This is an effective way to evaluate how effective matching was at achieving balance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Make a love plot of standardized mean differences (SMDs) before vs after matching.
-   Include a threshold line at 0.1.
-   In love plot display `mean.diffs`

```{r}

new_names <- data.frame(
    old = c("log_home_val_07", "p_uni_degree", "log_median_inc", "log_pop_denc"),
    new = c("Home Value (log)", "Percent University Degree",
            "Median Income (log)", "Population Density (log)"))

# Love plot
love.plot(match_model, stats = "mean.diffs",
          thresholds = c(m = 0.1),
          var.names = new_names)

```

**2D.Q1** Interpret the love plot in your own words:

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Propensity score matching

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2E. Propensity Score Matching (PSM)

-   Estimate 1:1 nearest-neighbor Propensity Score Matching
-   Same code as above except change `distance = "logit"`

```{r}

set.seed(2412026)

propensity_scores <- 
    
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Create table displaying covariate balance using `cobalt::bal.tab()`

📜 [Documentation - cobalt](https://ngreifer.github.io/cobalt/)

Use `bal.tab()` to report balance before and after matching.

```{r}

bal.tab(propensity_scores, 
        var.names = new_names) 

```

**2E.Q1** Compare Mahalanobis vs propensity score matching. Which method did a better job at achieving balance?

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2F. Estimate an effect in the matched sample

Using the matched data (Mahalanobis method), estimate the effect of treatment on the change in incumbent vote share (`change_liberal`).

```{r}

reg_match <- 

#summ(, model.fit = FALSE)
```

**2F.Q1** Have you identified a causal estimate using this approach: Why or why not?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Part 3: Panel Data, Fixed Effects, and Difference-in-Difference

**Data source:** [Dataverse-Stokes2015](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/SDUGCC)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3A:** Read in the panel data + code variables `precinct_id` and `year` as factors

```{r}

panel_data <- 

# HINT: Try running `tabyl(panel_data$year)`. Review article to make sense of the row numbers (n).

```

**3A.Q1:** Why are there 18,558 rows in `panel_data`?

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

```{r}
# How many years are included in the panel?

# How many precincts are there?

```

**3A.Q2:** How many unique precincts are *ever treated* (i.e., `proposed` & `operational`)?

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

```{r}

panel_data %>%
  group_by(precinct_id) %>%
  summarise(
    ever_proposed    = any(proposed_turbine == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    ever_operational = any(operational_turbine == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop") %>%
  summarise(
    n_ever_proposed    = sum(ever_proposed),
    n_ever_operational = sum(ever_operational))

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3B.** Plot and evaluate parallel trends: Replicate `Figure.2` (Stokes, 2015)

1.  Create indicators for whether each precinct is ever treated by 2011 (`treat_p`, `treat_o`; separate indicator for proposals and operational turbines).
2.  Plot mean incumbent vote share by year for treated vs control precincts (with 95% CIs).
3.  Facet by turbine type (proposed & operational)

Step 1: Prepare data

```{r}

trends_data <- panel_data %>%
  group_by(precinct_id) %>%
  mutate(
    treat_p = as.integer(any(proposed_turbine == 1, na.rm = TRUE)),  # ever proposed (in any year)
    treat_o = as.integer(any(operational_turbine == 1, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% # ever operational (in any year)
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(treat_p, treat_o),
               names_to = "turbine_type", values_to = "treat") %>% 
  mutate(
      turbine_type = factor(turbine_type,
                            levels = c("treat_p", "treat_o"),
                            labels = c("Proposed turbines", "Operational turbines")),  
    status = if_else(treat == 1, "Treated", "Control"),
    year   = factor(year))

```

Step 2: Create trends plot

```{r}

pd <- position_dodge(width = 0.15)

trends_data %>%
  group_by(turbine_type, status, year) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(perc_lib, na.rm = TRUE),
    n    = sum(!is.na(perc_lib)),
    se   = sd(perc_lib, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n), 
    ci   = qt(.975, df = pmax(n - 1, 1)) * se,
    .groups = "drop") %>%
ggplot(aes(year, mean, color = status, group = status)) +
  geom_line(position = pd, linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(position = pd, size = 2.6) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = mean - ci, ymax = mean + ci),
    position = pd, width = .12, linewidth = .7, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ turbine_type, nrow = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(Control = "#0072B2", Treated = "#B22222")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(.20, .57)) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure 2. Trends in the Governing Party’s Vote Share",
    x = "Election Year",
    y = "Liberal Party Vote Share",
    color = NULL) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"))

```

**3B.Q1:** Write a short paragraph assessing the parallel trends assumption for each outcome.

*Response (4-6 sentences):* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Estimating Fixed Effects Models (DiD) for proposals

$$
\text{Y}_{it}
=  \alpha_0 +
\beta \cdot (\text{proposed_turbine}_{it})
+ \gamma_i
+ \delta_t
+ \varepsilon_{it}
$$

-   $Y_{it}$ is the vote share for the Liberal Party in precinct *i* in time *t*
-   $\beta$ is the treatment effect of a turbine being proposed within a precinct
-   $\gamma_i$ is the precinct fixed effect
-   $\delta_t$ is the year fixed effect

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example 1: Randomly sample 40 precincts

-   To illustrate the "dummy variable method" of estimating fixed effects using the the general `lm()` function we are going to randomly sample 40 precincts (20 "treated" precincts with proposed turbines).
-   If we attempted to use this approach with the full sample estimating all 6185 (n-1) precinct-level coefficients is impractical (it would take a long time).

```{r}
set.seed(40002026)

precinct_frame <- panel_data %>%
  group_by(precinct_id) %>%
  summarise(
    proposed_turbine_any = as.integer(any(proposed_turbine == 1, na.rm = TRUE)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

ids_40 <- precinct_frame %>%
  group_by(proposed_turbine_any) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 20) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(precinct_id)

sample_40_precincts <- panel_data %>%
  semi_join(ids_40, by = "precinct_id")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3C:** Estimate a fixed effects model using `lm()` with fixed effects added for `precinct` and `year` using the sample of 40 precincts just created.

```{r}
model1_ff <- 

# summ(*** , model.fit = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# summ(*** , model.fit = FALSE, [. . .])
```

**3C.Q1:** Intuition check: Is the *signal-to-noise* ratio for the treatment estimate greater than *2-to-1*?

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

> HINT: Add the argument `digits = 3` to the `summ()` function above

**3C.Q2:** Re-run the `summ()` function using the *heteroscedasticiy robust standard error adjustment* (`robust = TRUE`). Did the standard error (S.E.) estimates change? Explain why.

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3C.Q3:** Compare results of the model above to the findings from the fixed effects analysis in the Stokes (2015) study. Why might the results be similar or different?

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3C.Q4:** In your own words, explain why it is advantageous from a causal inference perspective to include year and precinct fixed effects. Explain how between-level and within-level variance is relevant to the problem of omitted variable bias (OVB).

*Response (2-4 sentences):* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3D.** Now using the full sample, estimate the treatment effect of wind turbine proposals on incumbent vote share. Use `feols()` from the `{fixest}` package to estimate the fixed effects.

See vignette here: [fixest walkthrough](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fixest/vignettes/fixest_walkthrough.html#11_Estimation)

```{r}

model2_ff <- 

summary()
```

**3D.Q1:** Interpret the model results and translate findings to be clear to an audience that may not have a background in causal inference (Econometrics) methods.

In panel data settings, why is clustering by precinct important (i.e., `cluster = ~precinct_id`) ?”

*Response (4-6 sentences):* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3E.** Estimate the treatment effect of *operational wind turbines* on incumbent vote share. Use the same approach as the previous model.

```{r}

model3_ff <- 

summary()
```

**3E.Q1:** Interpret the `model3_ff` results as clearly and **concisely** as you can.

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3E.Q2:** Why do you think the effect of proposed wind turbines is different from operational wind turbines. Develop your own theory about why incumbent vote share is affected in this way. Use the Stokes (2015) study to inform your response as needed.

*Response:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
